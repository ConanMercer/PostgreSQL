    "Creating indexes is one way to make an execution more efficient, indexes are ordered subsets of data in a table. They can make it more efficient to search for attributes of a certain value. Types of common indexes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* B-tree index, self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches\n",
    "* Bitmap index, use bit arrays (commonly called bitmaps) and answer queries by performing bitwise logical operations on these bitmaps\n",
    "* Hash index, during lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes can speed up execution time because they reduce the need for full table scans. They can also help to enforce constraints, for example if a column has a unique constraint, before a new value is added to a row, checking if the corresponding value of the index column is already in the index will prompt a constraint conflict. This can be faster than checking the entire table with a full table scan."
